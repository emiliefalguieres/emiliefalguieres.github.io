My name is Emilie Falguieres and I am a 3rd Year PhD Student in Sociology at Northeastern University.

I am 37 years old and originally from Biarritz, France.

My research looks at the way individuals live through global economic restructuring, centered around the intersection of the precariat, global cities, mobility, and post-industrial class formation. I am specifically looking at how the urban nomad section of the precariat adapt themselves to the post-industrial organization of labor, keeping themselves geographically mobile to pivot to every new economic opportunity.
